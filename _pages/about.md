I'm a second-year postgraduate student at the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://cse.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). My research interest include, but are not limited to software security and large language models. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaoyuan Xie](https://xiaoyuanxie.github.io/) from the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University. I received my Bachelor's degree from the [School of Cyber Science and Technology (CST)](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University (SDU)](https://cst.qd.sdu.edu.cn/).
